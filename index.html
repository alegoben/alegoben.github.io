                <h2 class="s_title">Introduction</h2>
                <p>The term pressure is used in day-to-day life. To understand its meaning, consider 
                    the following examples of experiences with force on solids.
                </p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>A person makes deeper marks while walking on soft ground in high-heeled
                            shoes than in flat shoes.</li>
                            <figure><img src="4.1.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.1: High and flat-heeled shoes</i></figcaption></figure>
                        <li>It is easier to push a sharp pin through a cardboard than it is to push a 
                            blunt one through the same material using the same force, see figure 1.2 (a)
                            and (b).</li>
                            <figure><img src="4.2.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.2: Effect of force on an area</i></figcaption></figure>
                    </ol>
                <p>In all the above cases, a given force acting on an area causes a penetration,
                    depression or distortion. The effect is greater when the force acts on a smaller
                    area than when it acts on a larger area.
                    In general, when a force is applied on a given area, pressure is exerted on
                    the surface.
                    Pressure is defined as the <b> force acting normally (perpendicularly) per
                    unit area.</b></p>

                <h2 class="s_title">Units of Pressure</h2>
                <p>From the definition,</p>
                <img src="a.jpg" id="calc">
                <p>Therefore, the SI unit of pressure</p>
                <img src="b.jpg" id="calc">
                <p>The SI unit of pressure is thus newton per square metre (Nm<sup>–2</sup>), which is also 
                    called the Pascal (Pa).
                    1 Nm<sup>–2</sup> = 1 Pa 
                    Other units include the mmHg, the cmHg and an atmosphere (atm).</p>

                <h4>Apparatus</h4>
                <ul><li>tall tin, a small nail, water.</li></ul>
                <h4>Procedure</h4>
                <ul >
                    <li>Using the nail, make three holes, A, B and C, of the same diameter along a  
                        vertical line on one side of the tin.</li>
                    <li>Fill the tin with water as shown in figure 1.3.</li>
                    <li>With the tin full of water, observe the jets of water from the holes A, B and C.</li>

                </ul>
                <figure><img src="4.3.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.3: Pressure and depth</i></figcaption></figure>
                <h4>Observation</h4>
                <p>The lower hole, A, throws water the farthest distance z, followed by B distance y  
                    and lastly C distance x.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Pressure of water at A is greater than pressure at B and pressure at B is greater  
                    than at C. Hence, pressure increases with depth.  
                    Increase in pressure with depth explains why dam walls are constructed  
                    thicker at the bottom than at the top. See figure 1.4 below.</p>
                    <figure><img src="4.4.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.4: Curved wall and section of a dam</i></figcaption></figure>
                    <p>Additionally, the walls of the dam are curved to increase the surface area, hence  
                        reduce the pressure.</p>

                        This shows that the liquid flows to find its own height regardless of the shape of

                <p>
                    When water is poured into one arm of a U-tube, it will flow into the other arm.
                    The water will settle in the tube with the levels on both arms being the same, see
                    figure 1.6 (a).

                    <p>
                        When one arm of the U-tube is blown into with the mouth, the level moves
                        downwards, while in the other arm it rises, see figure between 1.6 (b). This is
                        caused by the pressure difference between the two arms. The pressure increases
                        on the arm that is blown into and causes water to rise on the other arm.

                    If A is the cross-section area of the column, h the height of the column and ρ the

                    = volume of the liquid × density <br>
                    = Ahρ   <br>
                    Therefore, weight of the liquid column  <br>

                    <img id="calc" src="h.jpg" >  <p>
                    Therefore, pressure P exerted by the column on A is given by, p = hρg <br>
                    From the formula P = hρg, it can be seen that the pressure due to a liquid column <br>

                    Pressure does not depend on the cross-section area of the container which holds

                    The hydraulic lift consists of a small piston S of cross-section area A1 and a
                    large piston L of cross-section area A2. When a force is applied on piston S, the
                    pressure generated by the force is transmitted throughout the liquid to piston L,
                    see figure 1.13.

                    Consider a force F1 applied on the small piston of cross-section area A1. Then,
                    pressure P1 generated on the liquid by the piston S due to F1 is given by;

                    This pressure is transmitted by the liquid to the larger piston L. Therefore,
                    pressure of liquid acting on the area A2 of the large piston is equal to P1. Thus,
                    the force F2 produced on the large piston is given by; <br>

                    Figure 1.16 (a) shows the earth’s atmosphere. The atmosphere thins outwards,
                    indicating the density of air decreases with the distance from the surface of the
                    earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider a column of air as in figure 1.16 (b), extending vertically into
                    space to the end of the atmosphere. This column of air stands on the earth’s
                    surface like a liquid in a tube and exerts pressure on the surface of the earth. The
                    pressure exerted on the surface of the earth by the weight of the air column is
                    called <b> atmospheric pressure.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The existence of atmospheric pressure is demonstrated by the experiment
                    below.

                <h4>Procedure</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the cork from the container and pour in some little water.</li>
                    <li>Boil the water for several minutes.</li>
                    <li>Replace the cork and allow the container to cool. You may pour cold water on
                        it to cool it faster. Observe what happens to the container.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <h4>observation</h4>
                <p>During cooling, the container is crushed in.</p>
                
                <h4>Expalnation</h4>
                <p>
                    Steam from boiling water drives out most of the air inside the container, see
                    figure 1.17 (a). When the cork is first replaced, the steam pressure inside the
                    container balances the atmospheric pressure outside. On cooling, the steam
                    condenses.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A partial vacuum is therefore created in the container. Since pressure inside
                    the container is less than atmospheric pressure outside, the container is crushed,
                    see figure 1.17 (b).

                </p>
                <h3>Maximum Column of Liquid that can be Supported by Atmospheric
                    Pressure</h3>
                <p>When water is sucked up a straw as in figure 1.18, the air pressure inside the
                    straw reduces.</p>
                <figure><img src="4.18.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.18: The working of the drinking straw</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    The atmospheric pressure acting on the water surface is now greater than
                    the pressure inside the straw. Water is thus pushed up the straw by the
                    atmospheric pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the straw was long enough and sealed at the top, it would be possible to
                    estimate the height of water in the straw that would be supported by atmospheric
                    pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A more convenient method is to use a glass tube sealed at one end, as in
                    figure 1.19 (a).
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.19.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.19: Water and mercury columns supported by atmospheric pressure</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    Fill glass tubes of different lengths completely with water and invert them in a
                    water reservoir. You will realise that the water column can be very large, in fact
                    too large for your available apparatus to accommodate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if mercury, which is much denser than water is used, the column
                    supported is found to be much shorter, see figure 1.19 (b). In this figure, the
                    mercury column in the tube exerts pressure at point B. For the height of this
                    column to remain constant, there must be a counter pressure to hold it up. This
                    counter pressure is provided by the atmosphere. At sea level, the atmospheric
                    pressure supports approximately 76 cm of mercury column or approximately 10
                    m of water column.

                <p>
                    A manometer is an instrument that can measure fluid pressure. It consists of a Utube
                    filled with water or any other suitable liquid, see figure 1.20.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose one limb of the manometer is connected to a gas supply. Due to
                    the pressure of the gas Pg, the water level in the other limb rises to, say, Y. This
                    difference in water levels is the difference between gas pressure Pg and the
                    atmospheric pressure Pa.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Since X and Z are at the same horizontal level, pressure at X equals
                    pressure at Z. Pressure at X is pressure of gas Pg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pressure at Z = atmospheric pressure + pressure due to the column of water <br>
                    Therefore, Pg = Pa + hρg <br>
                    Since density of water, ρ, and g are known, we can determine pressure of gas if
                    the atmospheric pressure is known. <br>

                <p>
                    It has been shown that atmospheric pressure supports a liquid column in a tube.
                    When this arrangement is used to measure pressure, it is called a <b> barometer.</b>

                </p>
                <p>
                    At sea level, a column of mercury and water supported by atmospheric
                    pressure is approximately 76 cm and 10 m respectively. Mercury, which is about
                    14 times denser than water, is chosen for atmospheric pressure measurements
                    since it gives a much shorter and measurable column.
                </p>
                <h3>Simple Mercury Barometer</h3>
                <p>
                    The simple mercury barometer comprises a thick-walled glass tube of about one
                    metre long and sealed at one end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is carefully filled with mercury to the top and any bubbles of air in the
                    tube removed by closing the open end and inverting it severally. It is necessary
                    to remove the bubbles because they make the barometer defective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tube is refilled and the open end closed tightly. It is then inverted into a
                    dish filled with mercury and supported upright with a stand and clamp, see
                    figure 1.21. The tightly closed end is then opened while under the surface of the
                    mercury. The column of mercury in the tube drops to create a vacuum in the
                    space above the column.

                <figure><img src="4.21.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.21: Simple mercury barometer</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    The height h of the column (barometric height) is a measure of the atmospheric <br>
                    pressure. <br>
                    At sea level, h = 76 cmHg.<br>
                    Since density ρ of mercury is 13 600 kgm–3,<br>
                    Pa = hρg<br>
                    = 0.76 × 13 600 × 10<br>
                    = 103 360 Nm–2<br>
                    This is the standard atmospheric pressure, and is sometimes referred to as<br>
                    <b> one atmosphere.</b> <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Testing the Vacuum Barometer</h3>
                <p>
                    If the barometer has air at the top, then it is faulty. The value of pressure
                    indicated by such a barometer is less than the actual value since the trapped air
                    also exerts pressure on the mercury column.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To test for the vacuum, the tube is tilted as shown in figure 1.22 (a) so that the
                    topmost part of the tube is below the height that is supported by atmospheric
                    pressure.

                <p>
                    If there is air in the tube, the mercury will not fill the tube completely. However,
                    if the space is a vacuum, the mercury fills the tube completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The space above the mercury in the tube when upright is called <b> Toricellian
                    vacuum</b> and contains a little mercury vapour.

                <p>
                    Before taking the reading, the level of mercury surface in the reservoir is
                    adjusted by turning the adjusting screw until the surface of the mercury just
                    touches the tip of the ivory index. The mirror-like mercury surface produces an
                    image of the tip which helps to make the adjustment very accurate. The height of
                    mercury is then read from the main scale and the vernier scale. Any change in air
                    pressure makes the surface of mercury in the reservoir move up and down and
                    therefore this adjustment is necessary before the barometer is read. The height of
                    mercury is read from the top part of the meniscus.

                <p>
                    The readings obtained from the barometer are in terms of the height of
                    mercury column and are written as mmHg or cmHg (Hg is the chemical symbol
                    for mercury). Therefore, the atmospheric pressure at sea level is expressed as
                    760 mmHg. It is important however to note that pressure is force per unit area,
                    but not a length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The atmospheric pressure Pa when the mercury column is 760 mm long is <br>

                <p>
                    The mercury barometer is the most reliable type of barometer, but is not readily
                    portable.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.24.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.24: Aneroid barometer</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    The aneroid barometer is a portable type of barometer consisting of a
                    sealed, corrugated metal box, as shown in figure 1.24. This metal box expands a
                    little if pressure outside is reduced, and reduces in volume a little if subjected to
                    higher pressure from outside. The motion due to the changes in shape of the
                    metal box is magnified by the corresponding movements of the spring strips,
                    lever arm, chain and finally the pointer on the scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally, the pointer would indicate a particular value of the atmospheric
                    pressure of the surrounding so that any changes in pressure would be noticeable
                    by the movement of the pointer to either side of this atmospheric value on the
                    scale.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The aneroid barometer movements make it adaptable to measure heights.
                    Altimeters are basically aneroid barometers, and are used in aircrafts to measure
                    heights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aneroid barometer is normally calibrated in millibars. 1 bar is a
                    pressure of 100 000 Nm–2 (standard atmospheric pressure)

                       <br> They are basically made of coiled flexible metal tubes which uncoil when
                    the pressure inside increases. The movement of the tube is made to drive a
                    pointer across a scale, through a combined system of levers and gears, see figure
                    1.25.

                <h3>The Bicycle Pump</h3>
                <p>
                    A bicycle pump is a simple form of a compression pump. Figure 1.26 shows the
                    main parts of the pump.

                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.26.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.26: Bicycle pump</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    It has a flexible leather washer which works both as a valve and a piston inside
                    the pump barrel. Before the pump is used, it is connected to the tyre which has a
                    rubber valve in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the pump handle is drawn out as shown, the volume of air below the
                    washer increases and its pressure is reduced below the atmospheric pressure. Air
                    from outside the pump then flows past the leather washer into the barrel. At the
                    same time, the higher air pressure in the tube closes the tyre valve.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When the pump handle is pushed in, the air in the pump barrel is
                    compressed. The high pressure in the barrel presses the leather washer against
                    the sides of the barrel. When the pressure of the compressed air becomes greater
                    than that of air in the tyre, air is forced into the tyre through the tyre valve which
                    now opens.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that there is an increase in temperature of the pump barrel during
                    pumping. This is because of the work done in compressing air.

                </p>
                <h3>The Lift Pump</h3>
                <p>
                    A lift pump is used to raise water from wells. It consists of a cylindrical metal
                    barrel with a spout. It has two valves, P and Q, as shown in figure 1.27.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start the pump, water is poured on top of the piston (priming) so that a
                    good air-tight seal is made round the piston and valve P. The pump is operated
                    by means of a lever as shown in the figure.
                </p>
                <h4>Upstroke</h4>
                <p>
                    When the plunger moves up during the upstroke, valve P closes due to its weight
                    and pressure of water above it. At the same time, air above valve Q expands and
                    its pressure reduces below atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure on
                    water in the well below thus pushes water up past valve Q into the barrel, as
                    shown in figure 1.27 (a). <br>
                    The plunger is moved up and down until the space between P and Q is
                    filled with water.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.27.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.27: Lift pump</i></figcaption></figure>
                <h4>Downstroke</h4>
                <p>
                    During downstroke, valve Q closes due to its weight and pressure of water
                    above, see figure 1.27 (b). <br>
                    Water is forced out through valve P and thus flows out of the spout.
                </p>
                <h5>Limitations of this pump</h5>
                <p>
                    The atmospheric pressure can only support a column of water of about 10 m.
                    This is, therefore, the theoretical maximum height to which water can be raised
                    by the pump at normal atmospheric pressure.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In practice, the possible height of water can be raised by this pump is less
                    than 10 m because of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>reduced atmospheric pressure in places high above sea level</li>
                        <li>leakages at the valves and pistons.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>The Force Pump</h3>
                <p>
                    This pump can be used to raise water to heights of more than 10 m.
                </p>
                <h4>Upstroke</h4>
                <p>
                    During upstroke, air above the valve S expands and its pressure reduces below
                    atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure on the water in the well below
                    pushes water up valve S into the barrel. Note that pressure above valve T is
                    atmospheric. Hence, this valve does not open in this stroke, see figure 1.28 (a).
                </p>
                <h4>Downstroke</h4>
                <p>
                    During the downstroke, the valve S closes, see figure 1.28 (b). Increase in
                    pressure in the water in the barrel opens valve T and forces water into chamber
                    C so that as water fills the chamber, air is trapped and compressed at the upper
                    part.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.28.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.28: Force pump</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    During the next upstroke, valve T closes and the compressed air expands,
                    ensuring a continuous flow through P.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This pump has an advantage over the lift pump in that it enables a
                    continuous flow of water and the height to which water can be raised by this
                    pump does not depend on atmospheric pressure, but on the following:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Amount of force applied during the downstroke</li>
                        <li>Ability of the pump and its working parts to withstand pressure of the long
                            column of water in chamber C.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>The Siphon</h3>
                <p>
                    A tube (usually plastic or rubber) can be used to empty tanks or draw petrol from
                    petrol tanks of cars, as in figure 1.29. When used in this way, it is referred to as a
                    <b> siphon.</b>
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.29.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.29: The siphon</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    The pressure at the surface of the liquid is atmospheric. The tube is first filled
                    with the liquid and end C held below the surface. Pressure at C is greater than
                    that at the surface by an amount hρg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The liquid will continue to run out so long as the end C is below the liquid
                    surface. Pressure at A and B is atmospheric pressure since they are at the same
                    horizontal level. Pressure at C is equal to atmospheric pressure plus pressure due
                    to column h of the liquid. That is; <br>
                    Pressure at C <br>
                    Pc = Pa + hρg, where Pa is atmospheric pressure and ρ the density of water. The
                    excess presure hρg thus causes the liquid to flow out of the tube at C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The siphon will only work if:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>the end C of the tube is below the surface of A of the liquid to be emptied</li>
                        <li>the tube is first filled with the liquid, without any bubbles in it.</li>
                        <li>the tube does not rise above the height of the liquid surface A.</li>
                        <li>one end of the tube is inside the liquid to be emptied.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h4>Note:</h4>
                <p>
                    A siphon can operate in a vacuum. To understand this, consider a chain or thick
                    rope coiled into a bucket, raised above the ground and one end of it over a
                    pulley, see figure 1.30. The loose end A, when it is below the bucket will have a
                    net weight on it. This net weight resulting from the pull of gravity pulls down the
                    chain completely out of the bucket.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.30.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.30</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    This is how the siphon works in a vacuum. <br>
                    An application of the siphon is the automatic flushing unit, shown in figure 1.31. 
                </p>
                <figure><img src="4.31.jpg" ><figcaption> <i>figure 1.31: An automatic water flushing unit</i></figcaption></figure>
                <p>
                    It is used where constant cleaning is necessary, like urinals. When the water in
                    the tank fills above the top of the inverted U-tube, a pressure difference between
                    the two arms is created. This causes the water to flow out of the tank. The tap
                    can be adjusted to enable the flushing unit to flush at pre-determined intervals. <br>
                    The ordinary lavatory flusher is set to work by mechanically filling the tube with
                    water to create the necessary pressure difference.

                            47m in sea whose water has a density of 1200 kg/m3, calculate
                            the pressure experienced by the octopus (Take atmospheric
                            pressure = 1.0125 x 105 Pa)
